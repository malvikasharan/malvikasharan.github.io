                      As a community manager, <b>I involve and support its diverse community of researchers, educators, policymakers and other stakeholders in sharing best practices, while they adopt open practices in their work.</b>
                      <br>
                      With its moonshot goal to make "reproducibility too easy not to do", we develop and promote resources on guidance, recommendations, case studies and personal stories across five guides: Reproducible Research, Project Design, Collaboration, Communication and Ethical Research.
                      I record all the community practices and resources in the <a href="https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/community-handbook/community-handbook.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">community handbook</a>.
                      I involve in <b>strategy development, project planning and management</b> of this project.
                      <br>
                      In 2020, The Turing Way community grew three times in size with over 250 direct contributors of the <a href="https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GitHub repository</a>.
                      Together, they have developed 30 chapters with 134 subchapters and community resources.

                      Through 16-week long personal mentorship and cohort-based training, <b>our participants gain skills essential to create, lead, and sustain their projects openly</b>.
                      This project is co-led by me, Yo Yehudi and Berenice Batut by involving Open Science practitioners from all the around the world as mentors and experts (<a href="https://openlifesci.org/community" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our community</a>).
                      <br>
                      Through two cohorts in 2020, we have trained and enabled mentoring of nearly 50 projects led by 80 members from 6 continents.
                      We received funding from <a href="https://eventfund.codeforscience.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Code for Science and Society<a>, <a href="https://www.eosc-life.eu/news/4-projects-awarded-funding-within-first-training-open-call/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">EOSC-life Training Grant</a> and <a href="https://www.turing.ac.uk/sites/default/files/2020-09/online_training_call_-_guidelines.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Turing Online Training Grant</a> to run the 2021 cohorts in partnership with these organisations.
                      <br><b>As a co-lead of Open Life Science, I lead the planning, management and decision-making processes.</b>
                      This year we will be involving our members in developing policies, sustainability plans and guiding the direction of this project towards those who are yet to benefit from Open Science practices.

                      I <b>led outreach and community engagement plans</b> to facilitate skill exchange and interaction among the researchers from different groups.
                      It also included managing many in-person meetings, consulting activities, coordination with multiple stakeholders and outreach events.
                      <br>
                      In my role, I engaged in leadership and project management related tasks at various capacities.
                      I was regularly involved in designing events, developing course materials, handling logistics for outreach activities, delivering training courses, writing grant proposals, handling budgets, representing projects at international events, hosting informal/public-engagement events and project reporting.
                      I organised an taught in <b>more than 34 training courses on a variety of computational skills</b>.
                      Most of these courses were aimed at supporting researchers new to coding and automation to adopt reproducible and open practices in their work.
                      <br>
                      We involved expert practitioners in sharing their skills with others by inviting them to speak at informal seminars, maintain community resource (such as GitLab and Chat System), teach or help in a course and participate in the Bio-IT TaskForce meetings.
                      To highlight and incentivise these community members, I designed and launched the <a href="https://grp-bio-it.embl-community.io/blog/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">community blog forum</a> and <a href="https://bio-it.embl.de/bio-it-fellowship-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bio-IT Outreach and Training Fellowship</a>.

                      <b>Food history</b> is my favourite kind of history!
                      <br>
                      I love to learn how local ingredients, rituals and communities influence the creation and evolution of dishes. I love how they build peoples' identities, sense of belonging and memories and how they travel across borders to fuse with other ingredients, rituals and communities to create new identities, belongings and memories.
                      <br></br>
                      When not reading about food history, you can find me binge watching comedy shows and documentaries. Most days I manage to read books (or listen to audiobooks) on <b>science, philosophy, intersectionality, and fictions</b>. I have started reading Sci-Fi on recommendations from a 'tiny book club in need of a name' that has brought me a lot of joy during the COVID-19 lockdown. I sometimes sketch and paint (oil painting lately), strum a ukulele or play some keys on my piano - everything I wish I learned to do better!
                      <br></br>
                      It would be bizarre to say that my interest is to attend conferences, but working from home has reminded me how much I miss them. So, here I am, admitting that I love well-organised conferences where I get to meet and connect with people working on wonderful ideas.
